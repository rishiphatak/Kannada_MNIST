# Kannada_MNIST
A machine learning project created with TensorFlow to recognize handwritten digits in the Kannada language

In this project, I use the Keras API and a Kaggle dataset to create a model to recognize handwritten digits in the Kannada language
which is spoken in the state of Karnataka in India.

I also speak Kannada which made me even more interested in the project!
